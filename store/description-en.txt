MensaUPB shows you the menus of the Studentenwerk's restaurants: Mensa including Abendmensa, Hotspot
and Gownsmen Pub.

Planned Features:
* Automatic change of restaurant, so you get the correct menus at the right time
* Hiding of unwanted menus (containing certain allergens or just not tasty enough)

Permissions all are needed to use the Android sync framework - to remove 
the permissions I would have to replicate the sync framework myself. 
That would take too much work for very little benefit.
